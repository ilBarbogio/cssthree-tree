# cssthree-tree
A simple library to draw a tree-like graph from html nodes, for educational/illustrative purposes.
## Why cssthree-tree?
This project stems from an endeavour, of a much larger scope, in e-learning and education. This small library wants to give something back to the community, when a lot of our efforts had some chanche of becoming something good only thanks to such 'giants' as threejs.
## What does cssthree-tree needs?
Cssthree-tree works with threejs and katex, and nothing more than some knowledge of LaTeX, as it is born as a tool to teach STEM content. Other than that, some simple sintax is required to write an html page that will show content in a tree-structured graph.
